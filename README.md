# macOS X Software Archive
A general archive of macOS Software, whether it be system apps, HomeBrew, software officially released for macOS, unofficial ports, or anything in between!

macOS is owned by Apple. Other trademarks belong to their rightful owners.


## Installation

1. Download the repo (by either downloading as a zip file or cloning it to a folder)
2. Copy whatever app you want to use to the Applications folder.

   **WARNING**
   If you try to replace a system app (Say Messages for example), you might not be able to replace it normally. If you were to use an external program to delete or replace it for you (example: you run 7Zip on Mac OS to remove the Messages.app folder) you might break something!!!!! I'm not responsible for damages caused by replacing system files!!!!!

3. Enjoy
